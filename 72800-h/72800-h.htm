ABSTRACT</p>


<p class="nind">
IN connexion with the discussion of the physical interpretation of the
quantum theoretical methods developed during recent years, I should
like to make the following general remarks regarding the principles
underlying the description of atomic phenomena, which I hope may help
to harmonise the different views, apparently so divergent, concerning
this subject.</p>

The content of this paper is essentially the same as that
of a lecture on the present state of the quantum theory delivered on
Sept. 16, 1927, at the Volta celebration in Como. For a summary of the
theory just previous to the development of the new methods the reader
is referred to a lecture of the author, “Atomic Theory and Mechanics,”
published in this periodical (<i>NATURE</i>, <b>116</b>, 809; 1925).
The rapid development which has taken place since has given rise to a
considerable number of publications. The present paper is confined to a
few references to recent articles which have a special bearing on the
subject now under discussion.</p>

<p>The quantum theory is characterised by the acknowledgment of a
fundamental limitation in the classical physical ideas when applied to
atomic phenomena. The situation thus created is of a peculiar nature,
since our interpretation of the experimental material rests essentially
upon the classical concepts. Notwithstanding the difficulties which
hence are involved in the formulation of the quantum theory, it seems,
as we shall see, that its essence may be expressed in the so-called
quantum postulate, which attributes to any atomic process an essential
discontinuity, or rather individuality, completely foreign to the
classical theories and symbolised by Planck’s quantum of action.</p>

<p>This postulate implies a renunciation as regards the causal space-time
co-ordination of atomic processes. Indeed, our usual description of
physical phenomena is based entirely on the idea that the phenomena
concerned may be observed without disturbing them appreciably. This
appears, for example, clearly in the theory of relativity, which has
been so fruitful for the elucidation of the classical theories. As
emphasised by Einstein, every observation or measurement ultimately
rests on the coincidence of two independent events at the same
space-time point. Just these coincidences will not be affected by any
differences which the space-time co-ordination of different observers
otherwise may exhibit. Now the quantum postulate implies that any
observation of atomic phenomena will involve an interaction with the
agency of observation not to be neglected. Accordingly, an independent
reality in the ordinary physical sense can neither be ascribed to the
phenomena nor to the agencies of observation. After all, the concept
of observation is in so far arbitrary as it depends upon which objects
are included in the system to be observed. Ultimately every observation
can of course be reduced to our sense perceptions. The circumstance,
however, that in interpreting observations use has always to be made
of theoretical notions, entails that for every particular case it is
a question of convenience at what point the concept of observation
involving the quantum postulate with its inherent ‘irrationality’ is
brought in.</p>

<p>This situation has far-reaching consequences. On one hand, the
definition of the state of a physical system, as ordinarily understood,
claims the elimination of all external disturbances. But in that case,
according to the quantum postulate, any observation will be impossible,
and, above all, the concepts of space and time lose their immediate
sense. On the other hand, if in order to make observation possible we
permit certain interactions with suitable agencies of measurement, not
belonging to the system, an unambiguous definition of the state of the
system is naturally no longer possible, and there can be no question
of causality in the ordinary sense of the word. The very nature of the
quantum theory thus forces us to regard the space-time co-ordination
and the claim of causality, the union of which characterises the
classical theories, as complementary but exclusive features of the
description, symbolising the idealisation of observation and definition
respectively. Just as the relativity theory has taught us that the
convenience of distinguishing sharply between space and time rests
solely on the smallness of the velocities ordinarily met with compared
to the velocity of light, we learn from the quantum theory that the
appropriateness of our usual causal space-time description depends
entirely upon the small value of the quantum of action as compared to
the actions involved in ordinary sense perceptions. Indeed, in the
description of atomic phenomena, the quantum postulate presents us with
the task of developing a ‘complementarity’ theory the consistency of
which can be judged only by weighing the possibilities of definition
and observation.</p>

<p>This view is already clearly brought out by the much-discussed question
of the nature of light and the ultimate constituents of matter.
As regards light, its propagation in space and time is adequately
expressed by the electromagnetic theory. Especially the interference
phenomena <i>in vacuo</i> and the optical properties of material
media are completely governed by the wave theory superposition
principle. Nevertheless, the conservation of energy and momentum
during the interaction between radiation and matter, as evident in
the photoelectric and Compton effect, finds its adequate expression
just in the light quantum idea put forward by Einstein. As is well
known, the doubts regarding the validity of the superposition principle
on one hand and of the conservation laws on the other, which were
suggested by this apparent contradiction, have been definitely
disproved through direct experiments. This situation would seem clearly
to indicate the impossibility of a causal space-time description of
the light phenomena. On one hand, in attempting to trace the laws
of the time-spatial propagation of light according to the quantum
postulate, we are confined to statistical considerations. On the other
hand, the fulfilment of the claim of causality for the individual
light processes, characterised by the quantum of action, entails a
renunciation as regards the space-time description. Of course, there
can be no question of a quite independent application of the ideas of
space and time and of causality. The two views of the nature of light
are rather to be considered as different attempts at an interpretation
of experimental evidence in which the limitation of the classical
concepts is expressed in complementary ways.</p>

<p>The problem of the nature of the constituents of matter presents us
with an analogous situation. The individuality of the elementary
electrical corpuscles is forced upon us by general evidence.
Nevertheless, recent experience, above all the discovery of the
selective reflection of electrons from metal crystals, requires the
use of the wave theory superposition principle in accordance with the
original ideas of L. de Broglie. Just as in the case of light, we
have consequently in the question of the nature of matter, so far as
we adhere to classical concepts, to face an inevitable dilemma, which
has to be regarded as the very expression of experimental evidence.
In fact, here again we are not dealing with contradictory but with
complementary pictures of the phenomena, which only together offer a
natural generalisation of the classical mode of description. In the
discussion of these questions, it must be kept in mind that, according
to the view taken above, radiation in free space as well as isolated
material particles are abstractions, their properties on the quantum
theory being definable and observable only through their interaction
with other systems. Nevertheless, these abstractions are, as we shall
see, indispensable for a description of experience in connexion with
our ordinary space-time view.</p>

<p>The difficulties with which a causal space-time description is
confronted in the quantum theory, and which have been the subject of
repeated discussions, are now placed into the foreground by the recent
development of the symbolic methods. An important contribution to the
problem of a consistent application of these methods has been made
lately by Heisenberg (<i>Zeitschr. f. Phys</i>., <b>43</b>, 172; 1927).
In particular, he has stressed the peculiar reciprocal uncertainty
which affects all measurements of atomic quantities. Before we enter
upon his results it will be advantageous to show how the complementary
nature of the description appearing in this uncertainty is unavoidable
already in an analysis of the most elementary concepts employed in
interpreting experience.</p>

<p>The fundamental contrast between the quantum of action and the
classical concepts is immediately apparent from the simple formulæ
which form the common foundation of the theory of light quanta and
of the wave theory of material particles. If Planck’s constant be
denoted by <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/9.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h">,</span> as is well known,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.566ex; width: 20.904ex; height: 2.262ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
E_{\tau} = I \lambda = h,
\qquad \text{(1)}
"></span>
where <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.729ex; height: 1.538ex;" src="images/10.svg" alt=" " data-tex="E"> and <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.14ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/11.svg" alt=" " data-tex="I"> are energy and momentum respectively, <img style="vertical-align: -0.029ex; width: 1.17ex; height: 1.005ex;" src="images/12.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau">
and <img style="vertical-align: -0.027ex; width: 1.319ex; height: 1.597ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\lambda"> the corresponding period of vibration and wave-length.
In these formulæ the two notions of light and also of matter enter
in sharp contrast. While energy and momentum are associated with the
concept of particles, and hence may be characterised according to
the classical point of view by definite space-time co-ordinates, the
period of vibration and wave-length refer to a plane harmonic wave
train of unlimited extent in space and time. Only with the aid of the
superposition principle does it become possible to attain a connexion
with the ordinary mode of description. Indeed, a limitation of the
extent of the wave-fields in space and time can always be regarded
as resulting from the interference of a group of elementary harmonic
waves. As shown by de Broglie (Thèse, Paris, 1924), the translational
velocity of the individuals associated with the waves can be
represented by just the so-called group-velocity. Let us denote a plane
elementary wave by
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.667ex; width: 34.708ex; height: 2.364ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

numbers in the direction of the co-ordinate axes, which may be regarded
as vector components of the wave number <img style="vertical-align: -1.579ex; width: 6.623ex; height: 4.615ex;" src="images/20.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\sigma = \dfrac{1}{\lambda}">
in the direction of propagation. While the wave or phase velocity is
given by <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 2.287ex; height: 4.106ex;" src="images/21.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{\nu}{\sigma}">,</span> the group-velocity is defined by
<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 3.464ex; height: 4.676ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{d \nu}{d \sigma}">.</span> Now according to the relativity theory
we have for a particle with the velocity <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.097ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/23.svg" alt=" " data-tex="v">:</span>

I = \frac{v}{c^{2}}E
\quad \text{and} \quad vdI = dE,
"></span>
where <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.98ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/24.svg" alt=" " data-tex="c"> denotes the velocity of light. Hence by equation (1) the
phase velocity is <img style="vertical-align: -0.798ex; width: 2.387ex; height: 3.024ex;" src="images/25.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\frac{c^{2}}{v}"> and the group-velocity <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.097ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/23.svg" alt=" " data-tex="v">.</span> The
circumstance that the former is in general greater than the velocity
of light emphasises the symbolic character of these considerations.
At the same time, the possibility of identifying the velocity of the
particle with the group-velocity indicates the field of application
of space-time pictures in the quantum theory. Here the complementary
character of the description appears, since the use of wave-groups
is necessarily accompanied by a lack of sharpness in the definition
of period and wave-length, and hence also in the definition of the
corresponding energy and momentum as given by relation (1).</p>

<p>Rigorously speaking, a limited wave-field can only be obtained by the
superposition of a manifold of elementary waves corresponding to all
values of <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.199ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/26.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\nu"> and <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 2.395ex; height: 1.332ex;" src="images/17.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\sigma_{x}">,</span> <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.667ex; width: 2.264ex; height: 1.642ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\sigma_{y}">,</span> <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 2.224ex; height: 1.332ex;" src="images/19.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\sigma_{z}">.</span>
But the order of magnitude of the mean difference between these values
for two elementary waves in the group is given in the most favourable
case by the condition
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.667ex; width: 41.258ex; height: 2.287ex;" src="images/4.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

extension of the wave-field in time and in the directions of space
corresponding to the co-ordinate axes. These relations—well known
from the theory of optical instruments, especially from Rayleigh’s
investigation of the resolving power of spectral apparatus—express the
condition that the wave-trains extinguish each other by interference
at the space-time boundary of the wave-field. They may be regarded
also as signifying that the group as a whole has no phase in the
same sense as the elementary waves. From equation (1) we find thus:
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.667ex; width: 47.857ex; height: 2.364ex;" src="images/5.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\Delta t \Delta E = \Delta x \Delta I_x = \Delta y \Delta I_y
= \Delta z \Delta I_z = h
\qquad \text{(2)}
"></span>
as determining the highest possible accuracy in the definition of the
energy and momentum of the individuals associated with the wave-field.
In general, the conditions for attributing an energy and a momentum
value to a wave-field by means of formula (1) are much less favourable.
Even if the composition of the wave-group corresponds in the beginning
to the relations (2), it will in the course of time be subject to
such changes that it becomes less and less suitable for representing
an individual. It is this very circumstance which gives rise to the
paradoxical character of the problem of the nature of light and of
material particles. The limitation in the classical concepts expressed
through relation (2) is, besides, closely connected with the limited
validity of classical mechanics, which in the wave theory of matter
corresponds to the geometrical optics, in which the propagation of
waves is depicted through ‘rays.’ Only in this limit can energy and
momentum be unambiguously defined on the basis of space-time pictures.
For a general definition of these concepts we are confined to the
conservation laws, the rational formulation of which has been a
fundamental problem for the symbolical methods to be mentioned below.</p>

<p>In the language of the relativity theory, the content of the relations
(2) may be summarised in the statement that according to the quantum
theory a general reciprocal relation exists between the maximum
sharpness of definition of the space-time and energy-momentum vectors
associated with the individuals. This circumstance may be regarded as
a simple symbolical expression for the complementary nature of the
space-time description and the claims of causality. At the same time,
however, the general character of this relation makes it possible
to a certain extent to reconcile the conservation laws with the
space-time co-ordination of observations, the idea of a coincidence of
well-defined events in a space-time point being replaced by that of
unsharply defined individuals within finite space-time regions.</p>

<p>This circumstance permits us to avoid the well-known paradoxes which
are encountered in attempting to describe the scattering of radiation
by free electrical particles as well as the collision of two such
particles. According to the classical concepts, the description of
the scattering requires a finite extent of the radiation in space and
time, while in the change of the motion of the electron demanded by
the quantum postulate one seemingly is dealing with an instantaneous
effect taking place at a definite point in space. Just as in the
case of radiation, however, it is impossible to define momentum and
energy for an electron without considering a finite space-time region.
Furthermore, an application of the conservation laws to the process
implies that the accuracy of definition of the energy momentum vector
is the same for the radiation and the electron. In consequence,
according to relation (2), the associated space-time regions can be
given the same size for both individuals in interaction.</p>

<p>A similar remark applies to the collision between two material
particles, although the significance of the quantum postulate for this
phenomenon was disregarded before the necessity of the wave concept
was realised. Here this postulate does indeed represent the idea of
the individuality of the particles which, transcending the space-time
description, meets the claim of causality. While the physical content
of the light quantum idea is wholly connected with the conservation
theorems for energy and momentum, in the case of the electrical
particles the electric charge has to be taken into account in this
connexion. It is scarcely necessary to mention that for a more detailed
description of the interaction between individuals we cannot restrict
ourselves to the facts expressed by formulæ (1) and (2), but must
resort to a procedure which allows us to take into account the coupling
of the individuals, characterising the interaction in question, where
just the importance of the electric charge appears. As we shall see,
such a procedure necessitates a further departure from visualisation in
the usual sense.</p>

<p>In his investigations already mentioned on the consistency of the
quantum theoretical methods, Heisenberg has given the relation (2)
as an expression for the maximum precision with which the space-time
co-ordinates and momentum-energy components of a particle can
be measured simultaneously. His view was based on the following
consideration: On one hand, the co-ordinates of a particle can be
measured with any desired degree of accuracy by using, for example,
an optical instrument, provided radiation of sufficiently short
wave-length is used for illumination. According to the quantum theory,
however, the scattering of radiation from the object is always
connected with a finite change in momentum, which is the larger
the smaller the wave-length of the radiation used. The momentum of
a particle, on the other hand, can be determined with any desired
degree of accuracy by measuring, for example, the Doppler effect of
the scattered radiation, provided the wave-length of the radiation
is so large that the effect of recoil can be neglected, but then
the determination of the space co-ordinates of the particle becomes
correspondingly less accurate.</p>

<p>The essence of this consideration is the inevitability of the quantum
postulate in the estimation of the possibilities of measurement. A
closer investigation of the possibilities of definition would still
seem necessary in order to bring out the general complementary
character of the description. Indeed, a discontinuous change of energy
and momentum during observation could not prevent us from ascribing
accurate values to the space-time co-ordinates, as well as to the
momentum-energy components before and after the process. The reciprocal
uncertainty which always affects the values of these quantities is,
as will be clear from the preceding analysis, essentially an outcome
of the limited accuracy with which changes in energy and momentum can
be defined, when the wave-fields used for the determination of the
space-time co-ordinates of the particle are sufficiently small.</p>

<p>In using an optical instrument for determinations of position, it is
necessary to remember that the formation of the image always requires
a convergent beam of light. Denoting by <img style="vertical-align: -0.027ex; width: 1.319ex; height: 1.597ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\lambda"> the wave-length
of the radiation used, and by <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.919ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/30.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\epsilon"> the so-called numerical
aperture, that is, the sine of half the angle of convergence, the
resolving power of a microscope is given by the well-known expression
<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 3.045ex; height: 4.676ex;" src="images/31.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{\lambda}{2 \epsilon}">.</span> Even if the object is illuminated
by parallel light, so that the momentum <img style="vertical-align: -1.579ex; width: 2.314ex; height: 4.679ex;" src="images/32.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{h}{\lambda}"> of
the incident light quantum is known both as regards magnitude and
direction, the finite value of the aperture will prevent an exact
knowledge of the recoil accompanying the scattering. Also, even if the
momentum of the particle were accurately known before the scattering
process, our knowledge of the component of momentum parallel to the
focal plane after the observation would be affected by an uncertainty
amounting to <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -1.579ex; width: 4.348ex; height: 4.679ex;" src="images/33.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{2 \epsilon h}{\lambda}">.</span> The product of the
least accuracies with which the positional co-ordinate and the
component of momentum in a definite direction can be ascertained is
therefore just given by formula (2). One might perhaps expect that
in estimating the accuracy of determining the position, not only the
convergence but also the length of the wave-train has to be taken
into account, because the particle could change its place during the
finite time of illumination. Due to the fact, however, that the exact
knowledge of the wave-length is immaterial for the above estimate, it
will be realised that for any value of the aperture the wave-train can
always be taken so short that a change of position of the particle
during the time of observation may be neglected in comparison to the
lack of sharpness inherent in the determination of position due to the
finite resolving power of the microscope.</p>

<p>In measuring momentum with the aid of the Doppler effect—with due
regard to the Compton effect—one will employ a parallel wave-train.
For the accuracy, however, with which the change in wave-length of
the scattered radiation can be measured the extent of the wave-train
in the direction of propagation is essential. If we assume that the
directions of the incident and scattered radiation are parallel and
opposite respectively to the direction of the position co-ordinate
and momentum component to be measured, then <img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 3.294ex; height: 4.676ex;" src="images/34.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{c \lambda}{2l}">
can be taken as a measure of the accuracy in the determination of
the velocity, where <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.674ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/35.svg" alt=" " data-tex="l"> denotes the length of the wave-train. For
simplicity, we here have regarded the velocity of light as large
compared to the velocity of the particle. If <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.986ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/36.svg" alt=" " data-tex="m"> represents the mass
of the particle, then the uncertainty attached to the value of the
momentum after observation is <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 5.281ex; height: 4.676ex;" src="images/37.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{cm \lambda}{2l}">.</span> In this case
the magnitude of the recoil, <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -1.579ex; width: 3.43ex; height: 4.679ex;" src="images/38.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{2h}{\lambda}">,</span> is sufficiently
well defined in order not to give rise to an appreciable uncertainty
in the value of the momentum of the particle after observation.
Indeed, the general theory of the Compton effect allows us to compute
the momentum components in the direction of the radiation before and
after the recoil from the wave-lengths of the incident and scattered
radiation. Even if the positional co-ordinates of the particle were
accurately known in the beginning, our knowledge of the position after
observation nevertheless will be affected by an uncertainty. Indeed,
on account of the impossibility of attributing a definite instant to
the recoil, we know the mean velocity in the direction of observation
during the scattering process only with an accuracy <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -1.579ex; width: 4.301ex; height: 4.679ex;" src="images/39.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{2h}{m \lambda}">.</span>
The uncertainty in the position after observation hence is
<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -1.579ex; width: 5.281ex; height: 4.679ex;" src="images/40.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{2hl}{mc \lambda}">.</span> Here, too, the product of the inaccuracies
in the measurement of position and momentum is thus given by the
general formula (2).</p>

<p>Just as in the case of the determination of position, the time of the
process of observation for the determination of momentum may be made
as short as is desired if only the wave-length of the radiation used
is sufficiently small. The fact that the recoil then gets larger does
not, as we have seen, affect the accuracy of measurement. It should
further be mentioned, that in referring to the velocity of a particle
as we have here done repeatedly, the purpose has only been to obtain
a connexion with the ordinary space-time description convenient
in this case. As it appears already from the considerations of de
Broglie mentioned above, the concept of velocity must always in the
quantum theory be handled with caution. It will also be seen that an
unambiguous definition of this concept is excluded by the quantum
postulate. This is particularly to be remembered when comparing
the results of successive observations. Indeed, the position of an
individual at two given moments can be measured with any desired degree
of accuracy; but if, from such measurements, we would calculate the
velocity of the individual in the ordinary way, it must be clearly
realised that we are dealing with an abstraction, from which no
unambiguous information concerning the previous or future behaviour of
the individual can be obtained.</p>

<p>According to the above considerations regarding the possibilities of
definition of the properties of individuals, it will obviously make
no difference in the discussion of the accuracy of measurements of
position and momentum of a particle if collisions with other material
particles are considered instead of scattering of radiation. In both
cases we see that the uncertainty in question equally affects the
description of the agency of measurement and of the object. In fact,
this uncertainty cannot be avoided in a description of the behaviour of
individuals with respect to a co-ordinate system fixed in the ordinary
way by means of solid bodies and unperturbable clocks. The experimental
devices—opening and closing of apertures, etc.—are seen to permit
only conclusions regarding the space-time extension of the associated
wave-fields.</p>

<p>In tracing observations back to our sensations, once more regard has
to be taken to the quantum postulate in connexion with the perception
of the agency of observation, be it through its direct action upon the
eye or by means of suitable auxiliaries such as photographic plates,
Wilson clouds, etc. It is easily seen, however, that the resulting
additional statistical element will not influence the uncertainty in
the description of the object. It might even be conjectured that the
arbitrariness in what is regarded as object and what as agency of
observation would open up a possibility of avoiding this uncertainty
altogether. In connexion with the measurement of the position
of a particle, one might, for example, ask whether the momentum
transmitted by the scattering could not be determined by means of the
conservation theorem from a measurement of the change of momentum of
the microscope—including light source and photographic plate—during
the process of observation. A closer investigation shows, however, that
such a measurement is impossible, if at the same time one wants to
know the position of the microscope with sufficient accuracy. In fact,
it follows from the experiences which have found expression in the
wave theory of matter, that the position of the centre of gravity of a
body and its total momentum can only be defined within the limits of
reciprocal accuracy given by relation (2).</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, the idea of observation belongs to the causal
space-time way of description. Due to the general character of relation
(2), however, this idea can be consistently utilised also in the
quantum theory, if only the uncertainty expressed through this relation
is taken into account. As remarked by Heisenberg, one may even obtain
an instructive illustration to the quantum theoretical description
of atomic (microscopic) phenomena by comparing this uncertainty with
the uncertainty, due to imperfect measurements, inherently contained
in any observation as considered in the ordinary description of
natural phenomena. He remarks on that occasion that even in the case
of macroscopic phenomena we may say, in a certain sense, that they
are created by repeated observations. It must not be forgotten,
however, that in the classical theories any succeeding observation
permits a prediction of future events with ever-increasing accuracy,
because it improves our knowledge of the initial state of the system.
According to the quantum theory, just the impossibility of neglecting
the interaction with the agency of measurement means that every
observation introduces a new uncontrollable element. Indeed, it follows
from the above considerations that the measurement of the positional
co-ordinates of a particle is accompanied not only by a finite change
in the dynamical variables, but also the fixation of its position
means a complete rupture in the causal description of its dynamical
behaviour, while the determination of its momentum always implies a gap
in the knowledge of its spatial propagation. Just this situation brings
out most strikingly the complementary character of the description of
atomic phenomena which appears as an inevitable consequence of the
contrast between the quantum postulate and the distinction between
object and agency of measurement, inherent in our very idea of
observation.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have only regarded certain general features of the quantum
problem. The situation implies, however, that the main stress has
to be laid on the formulation of the laws governing the interaction
between the objects which we symbolise by the abstractions of isolated
particles and radiation. Points of attack for this formulation are
presented in the first place by the problem of atomic constitution. As
is well known, it has been possible here, by means of an elementary
use of classical concepts and in harmony with the quantum postulate,
to throw light on essential aspects of experience. For example, the
experiments regarding the excitation of spectra by electronic impacts
and by radiation are adequately accounted for on the assumption of
discrete stationary states and individual transition processes. This
is primarily due to the circumstance that in these questions no closer
description of the space-time behaviour of the processes is required.</p>

<p>Here the contrast with the ordinary way of description appears
strikingly in the circumstance that spectral lines, which on the
classical view would be ascribed to the same state of the atom, will,
according to the quantum postulate, correspond to separate transition
processes, between which the excited atom has a choice. Notwithstanding
this contrast, however, a formal connexion with the classical ideas
could be obtained in the limit, where the relative difference in the
properties of neighbouring stationary states vanishes asymptotically
and where in statistical applications the discontinuities may be
disregarded. Through this connexion it was possible to a large extent
to interpret the regularities of spectra on the basis of our ideas
about the structure of the atom.</p>

<p>The aim of regarding the quantum theory as a rational generalisation
of the classical theories led to the formulation of the so-called
correspondence principle. The utilisation of this principle for the
interpretation of spectroscopic results was based on a symbolical
application of classical electrodynamics, in which the individual
transition processes were each associated with a harmonic in the
motion of the atomic particles to be expected according to ordinary
mechanics. Except in the limit mentioned, where the relative
difference between adjacent stationary states may be neglected, such
a fragmentary application of the classical theories could only in
certain cases lead to a strictly quantitative description of the
phenomena. Especially the connexion developed by Ladenburg and Kramers
between the classical treatment of dispersion and the statistical laws
governing the radiative transition processes formulated by Einstein
should be mentioned here. Although it was just Kramers’ treatment of
dispersion that gave important hints for the rational development
of correspondence considerations, it is only through the quantum
theoretical methods created in the last few years that the general
aims laid down in the principle mentioned have obtained an adequate
formulation.</p>

<p>As is known, the new development was commenced in a fundamental paper
by Heisenberg, where he succeeded in emancipating himself completely
from the classical concept of motion by replacing from the very start
the ordinary kinematical and mechanical quantities by symbols, which
refer directly to the individual processes demanded by the quantum
postulate. This was accomplished by substituting for the Fourier
development of a classical mechanical quantity a matrix scheme,
the elements of which symbolise purely harmonic vibrations and are
associated with the possible transitions between stationary states. By
requiring that the frequencies ascribed to the elements must always
obey the combination principle for spectral lines, Heisenberg could
introduce simple rules of calculation for the symbols, which permit a
direct quantum theoretical transcription of the fundamental equations
of classical mechanics. This ingenious attack on the dynamical problem
of atomic theory proved itself from the beginning to be an exceedingly
powerful and fertile method for interpreting quantitatively the
experimental results. Through the work of Born and Jordan as well as
of Dirac, the theory was given a formulation which can compete with
classical mechanics as regards generality and consistency. Especially
the element characteristic of the quantum theory, Planck’s constant,
appears explicitly only in the algorithms to which the symbols, the
so-called matrices, are subjected. In fact, matrices, which represent
canonically conjugated variables in the sense of the Hamiltonian
equations, do not obey the commutative law of multiplication, but two
such quantities, <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.041ex; height: 1.439ex;" src="images/41.svg" alt=" " data-tex="q"> and <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.138ex; height: 1.439ex;" src="images/42.svg" alt=" " data-tex="p">,</span> have to fulfil the exchange rule
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 25.794ex; height: 4.676ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
pq - qp = \sqrt{-1} \frac{h}{2 \pi }
\qquad \text{(3)}
"></span>
Indeed, this exchange relation expresses strikingly the symbolical
character of the matrix formulation of the quantum theory. The matrix
theory has often been called a calculus with directly observable
quantities. It must be remembered, however, that the procedure
described is limited just to those problems, in which in applying
the quantum postulate the space-time description may largely be
disregarded, and the question of observation in the proper sense
therefore placed in the background.</p>

<p>In pursuing further the correspondence of the quantum laws with
classical mechanics, the stress placed on the statistical character of
the quantum theoretical description, which is brought in by the quantum
postulate, has been of fundamental importance. Here the generalisation
of the symbolical method made by Dirac and Jordan represented a great
progress by making possible the operation with matrices, which are not
arranged according to the stationary states, but where the possible
values of any set of variables may appear as indices of the matrix
elements. In analogy to the interpretation considered in the original
form of the theory of the ‘diagonal elements’ connected only with
a single stationary state, as time averages of the quantity to be
represented, the general transformation theory of matrices permits
the representation of such averages of a mechanical quantity, in the
calculation of which any set of variables characterising the ‘state’
of the system have given values, while the canonically conjugated
variables are allowed to take all possible values. On the basis of the
procedure developed by these authors and in close connexion with ideas
of Born and Pauli, Heisenberg has in the paper already cited above
attempted a closer analysis of the physical content of the quantum
theory, especially in view of the apparently paradoxical character of
the exchange relation (3). In this connexion he has formulated the
relation
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.566ex; width: 17.685ex; height: 2.262ex;" src="images/7.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\Delta q \Delta p \sim h
\qquad \text{(4)}
"></span>
as the general expression for the maximum accuracy with which two
canonically conjugated variables can simultaneously be observed. In
this way Heisenberg has been able to elucidate many paradoxes appearing
in the application of the quantum postulate, and to a large extent
to demonstrate the consistency of the symbolic method. In connexion
with the complementary nature of the quantum theoretical description,
we must, as already mentioned, constantly keep the possibilities
of definition as well as of observation before the mind. For the
discussion of just this question the method of wave mechanics developed
by Schrödinger has, as we shall see, proved of great help. It permits
a general application of the principle of superposition also in the
problem of interaction, thus offering an immediate connexion with the
above considerations concerning radiation and free particles. Below
we shall return to the relation of wave mechanics to the general
formulation of the quantum laws by means of the transformation theory
of matrices.</p>

</div>


<p>Already in his first considerations concerning the wave theory of
material particles, de Broglie pointed out that the stationary states
of an atom may be visualised as an interference effect of the phase
wave associated with a bound electron. It is true that this point of
view at first did not, as regards quantitative results, lead beyond
the earlier methods of quantum theory, to the development of which
Sommerfeld has contributed so essentially. Schrödinger, however,
succeeded in developing a wave-theoretical method which has opened
up new aspects, and has proved to be of decisive importance for the
great progress in atomic physics during the last years. Indeed, the
proper vibrations of the Schrödinger wave equation have been found
to furnish a representation of the stationary states of an atom
meeting all requirements. The energy of each state is connected
with the corresponding period of vibration according to the general
quantum relation (1). Furthermore, the number of nodes in the various
characteristic vibrations gives a simple interpretation to the concept
of quantum number which was already known from the older methods, but
at first did not seem to appear in the matrix formulation. In addition,
Schrödinger could associate with the solutions of the wave equation a
continuous distribution of charge and current, which, if applied to a
characteristic vibration, represents the electrostatic and magnetic
properties of an atom in the corresponding stationary state. Similarly,
the superposition of two characteristic solutions corresponds to a
continuous vibrating distribution of electrical charge, which on
classical electrodynamics would give rise to an emission of radiation,
illustrating instructively the consequences of the quantum postulate
and the correspondence requirement regarding the transition process
between two stationary states formulated in matrix mechanics. Another
application of the method of Schrödinger, important for the further
development, has been made by Born in his investigation of the problem
of collisions between atoms and free electric particles. In this
connexion he succeeded in obtaining a statistical interpretation of
the wave functions, allowing a calculation of the probability of the
individual transition processes required by the quantum postulate. This
includes a wave-mechanical formulation of the adiabatic principle of
Ehrenfest, the fertility of which appears strikingly in the promising
investigations of Hund on the problem of formation of molecules.</p>

<p>In view of these results, Schrödinger has expressed the hope that the
development of the wave theory will eventually remove the irrational
element expressed by the quantum postulate and open the way for
a complete description of atomic phenomena along the line of the
classical theories. In support of this view, Schrödinger, in a recent
paper (<i>Ann. d. Phys</i>., <b>88</b>, p. 956; 1927), emphasises
the fact that the discontinuous exchange of energy between atoms
required by the quantum postulate, from the point of view of the wave
theory, is replaced by a simple resonance phenomenon. In particular,
the idea of individual stationary states would be an illusion and
its applicability only an illustration of the resonance mentioned.
It must be kept in mind, however, that just in the resonance problem
mentioned we are concerned with a closed system which, according to the
view presented here, is not accessible to observation. In fact, wave
mechanics just as the matrix theory on this view represents a symbolic
transcription of the problem of motion of classical mechanics adapted
to the requirements of quantum theory and only to be interpreted by an
explicit use of the quantum postulate. Indeed, the two formulations of
the interaction problem might be said to be complementary in the same
sense as the wave and particle idea in the description of the free
individuals. The apparent contrast in the utilisation of the energy
concept in the two theories is just connected with this difference in
the starting-point.</p>

<p>The fundamental difficulties opposing a space-time description
of a system of particles in interaction appear at once from the
inevitability of the superposition principle in the description of
the behaviour of individual particles. Already for a free particle
the knowledge of energy and momentum excludes, as we have seen, the
exact knowledge of its space-time co-ordinates. This implies that an
immediate utilisation of the concept of energy in connexion with the
classical idea of the potential energy of the system is excluded.
In the Schrödinger wave equation these difficulties are avoided by
replacing the classical expression of the Hamiltonian by a differential
operator by means of the relation
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.991ex; width: 23.415ex; height: 5.143ex;" src="images/8.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

\qquad \text{(5)}
"></span>
where <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.138ex; height: 1.439ex;" src="images/42.svg" alt=" " data-tex="p"> denotes a generalised component of momentum and <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.041ex; height: 1.439ex;" src="images/41.svg" alt=" " data-tex="q"> the
canonically conjugated variable. Hereby the negative value of the
energy is regarded as conjugated to the time. So far, in the wave
equation, time and space as well as energy and momentum are utilised in
a purely formal way.</p>

<p>The symbolical character of Schrödinger’s method appears not only
from the circumstance that its simplicity, similarly to that of the
matrix theory, depends essentially upon the use of imaginary arithmetic
quantities. But above all there can be no question of an immediate
connexion with our ordinary conceptions because the ‘geometrical’
problem represented by the wave equation is associated with the
so-called co-ordinate space, the number of dimensions of which is equal
to the number of degrees of freedom of the system, and hence in general
greater than the number of dimensions of ordinary space. Further,
Schrödinger’s formulation of the interaction problem, just as the
formulation offered by matrix theory, involves a neglect of the finite
velocity of propagation of the forces claimed by relativity theory.</p>

<p>On the whole, it would scarcely seem justifiable, in the case of the
interaction problem, to demand a visualisation by means of ordinary
space-time pictures. In fact, all our knowledge concerning the internal
properties of atoms is derived from experiments on their radiation or
collision reactions, such that the interpretation of experimental facts
ultimately depends on the abstractions of radiation in free space, and
free material particles. Hence, our whole space-time view of physical
phenomena, as well as the definition of energy and momentum, depends
ultimately upon these abstractions. In judging the applications of
these auxiliary ideas we should only demand inner consistency, in
which connexion special regard has to be paid to the possibilities of
definition and observation.</p>

<p>In the characteristic vibrations of Schrödinger’s wave equation we
have, as mentioned, an adequate representation of the stationary states
of an atom allowing an unambiguous definition of the energy of the
system by means of the general quantum relation (1). This entails,
however, that in the interpretation of observations, a fundamental
renunciation regarding the space-time description is unavoidable. In
fact, the consistent application of the concept of stationary states
excludes, as we shall see, any specification regarding the behaviour
of the separate particles in the atom. In problems where a description
of this behaviour is essential, we are bound to use the general
solution of the wave equation which is obtained by superposition of
characteristic solutions. We meet here with a complementarity of the
possibilities of definition quite analogous to that which we have
considered earlier in connexion with the properties of light and free
material particles. Thus, while the definition of energy and momentum
of individuals is attached to the idea of a harmonic elementary wave,
every space-time feature of the description of phenomena is, as we
have seen, based on a consideration of the interferences taking place
inside a group of such elementary waves. Also in the present case
the agreement between the possibilities of observation and those of
definition can be directly shown.</p>

<p>According to the quantum postulate any observation regarding the
behaviour of the electron in the atom will be accompanied by a change
in the state of the atom. As stressed by Heisenberg, this change will,
in the case of atoms in stationary states of low quantum number,
consist in general in the ejection of the electron from the atom. A
description of the ‘orbit’ of the electron in the atom with the aid of
subsequent observations is hence impossible in such a case. This is
connected with the circumstance that from characteristic vibrations
with only a few nodes no wave packages can be built up which would even
approximately represent the ‘motion’ of a particle. The complementary
nature of the description, however, appears particularly in that the
use of observations concerning the behaviour of particles in the
atom rests on the possibility of neglecting, during the process of
observation, the interaction between the particles, thus regarding
them as free. This requires, however, that the duration of the process
is short compared with the natural periods of the atom, which again
means that the uncertainty in the knowledge of the energy transferred
in the process is large compared to the energy differences between
neighbouring stationary states.</p>

<p>In judging the possibilities of observation it must, on the whole, be
kept in mind that the wave mechanical solutions can be visualised only
in so far as they can be described with the aid of the concept of free
particles. Here the difference between classical mechanics and the
quantum theoretical treatment of the problem of interaction appears
most strikingly. In the former such a restriction is unnecessary,
because the ‘particles’ are here endowed with an immediate ‘reality,’
independently of their being free or bound. This situation is
particularly important in connexion with the consistent utilisation
of Schrödinger’s electric density as a measure of the probability
for electrons being present within given space regions of the atom.
Remembering the restriction mentioned, this interpretation is seen
to be a simple consequence of the assumption that the probability of
the presence of a free electron is expressed by the electric density
associated with the wave-field in a similar way to that by which the
probability of the presence of a light quantum is given by the energy
density of the radiation.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, the means for a general consistent utilisation
of the classical concepts in the quantum theory have been created
through the transformation theory of Dirac and Jordan, by the aid of
which Heisenberg has formulated his general uncertainty relation (4).
In this theory also the Schrödinger wave equation has obtained an
instructive application. In fact, the characteristic solutions of this
equation appear as auxiliary functions which define a transformation
from matrices with indices representing the energy values of the system
to other matrices, the indices of which are the possible values of the
space co-ordinates. It is also of interest in this connexion to mention
that Jordan and Klein (<i>Zeitsch. f. Phys</i>., <b>45</b>, 751; 1927)
have recently arrived at the formulation of the problem of interaction
expressed by the Schrödinger wave equation, taking as starting-point
the wave representation of individual particles and applying a symbolic
method closely related to the deep-going treatment of the radiation
problem developed by Dirac from the point of view of the matrix theory,
to which we shall return below.</p>

<p>In the conception of stationary states we are, as mentioned, concerned
with a characteristic application of the quantum postulate. By its very
nature this conception means a complete renunciation as regards a time
description. From the point of view taken here, just this renunciation
forms the necessary condition for an unambiguous definition of the
energy of the atom. Moreover, the conception of a stationary state
involves, strictly speaking, the exclusion of all interactions with
individuals not belonging to the system. The fact that such a closed
system is associated with a particular energy value may be considered
as an immediate expression for the claim of causality contained in
the theorem of conservation of energy. This circumstance justifies
the assumption of the supra-mechanical stability of the stationary
states, according to which the atom, before as well as after an
external influence, always will be found in a well-defined state, and
which forms the basis for the use of the quantum postulate in problems
concerning atomic structure.</p>

<p>In a judgment of the well-known paradoxes which this assumption
entails for the description of collision and radiation reactions,
it is essential to consider the limitations of the possibilities of
definition of the reacting free individuals, which is expressed by
relation (2). In fact, if the definition of the energy of the reacting
individuals is to be accurate to such a degree as to entitle us to
speak of conservation of energy during the reaction, it is necessary,
according to this relation, to co-ordinate to the reaction a time
interval long compared to the vibration period associated with the
transition process, and connected with the energy difference between
the stationary states according to relation (1). This is particularly
to be remembered when considering the passage of swiftly moving
particles through an atom. According to the ordinary kinematics, the
effective duration of such a passage would be very small as compared
with the natural periods of the atom, and it seemed impossible to
reconcile the principle of conservation of energy with the assumption
of the stability of stationary states (cf. <i>Zeits. f. Phys</i>.,
<b>34</b>, 142; 1925). In the wave representation, however, the time of
reaction is immediately connected with the accuracy of the knowledge
of the energy of the colliding particle, and hence there can never
be the possibility of a contradiction with the law of conservation.
In connexion with the discussion of paradoxes of the kind mentioned,
Campbell (<i>Phil. Mag</i>., i. 1106; 1926) suggested the view that
the conception of time itself may be essentially statistical in
nature. From the view advanced here, according to which the foundation
of space-time description is offered by the abstraction of free
individuals, a fundamental distinction between time and space, however,
would seem to be excluded by the relativity requirement. The singular
position of the time in problems concerned with stationary states is,
as we have seen, due to the special nature of such problems.</p>

<p>The application of the conception of stationary states demands that
in any observation, say by means of collision or radiation reactions,
permitting a distinction between different stationary states, we are
entitled to disregard the previous history of the atom. The fact that
the symbolical quantum theory methods ascribe a particular phase to
each stationary state the value of which depends upon the previous
history of the atom, would for the first moment seem to contradict the
very idea of stationary states. As soon as we are really concerned
with a time problem, however, the consideration of a strictly closed
system is excluded. The use of simply harmonic proper vibrations in
the interpretation of observations means, therefore, only a suitable
idealisation which in a more rigorous discussion must always be
replaced by a group of harmonic vibrations, distributed over a finite
frequency interval. Now, as already mentioned, it is a general
consequence of the superposition principle that it has no sense to
co-ordinate a phase value to the group as a whole, in the same manner
as may be done for each elementary wave constituting the group.</p>

<p>This inobservability of the phase, well known from the theory of
optical instruments, is brought out in a particularly simple manner
in a discussion of the Stern-Gerlach experiment, so important for the
investigation of the properties of single atoms. As pointed out by
Heisenberg, atoms with different orientation in the field may only be
separated if the deviation of the beam is larger than the diffraction
at the slit of the de Broglie waves representing the translational
motion of the atoms. This condition means, as a simple calculation
shows, that the product of the time of passage of the atom through
the field, and the uncertainty due to the finite width of the beam of
its energy in the field, is at least equal to the quantum of action.
This result was considered by Heisenberg as a support of relation (2)
as regards the reciprocal uncertainties of energy and time values.
It would seem, however, that here we are not simply dealing with a
measurement of the energy of the atom at a given time. But since the
period of the proper vibrations of the atom in the field is connected
with the total energy by relation (1), we realise that the condition
for separability mentioned just means the loss of the phase. This
circumstance removes also the apparent contradictions, arising in
certain problems concerning the coherence of resonance radiation, which
have been discussed frequently, and were also considered by Heisenberg.</p>

<p>To consider an atom as a closed system, as we have done above, means
to neglect the spontaneous emission of radiation which even in the
absence of external influences puts an upper limit to the lifetime
of the stationary states. The fact that this neglect is justified in
many applications is connected with the circumstance that the coupling
between the atom and the radiation field, which is to be expected on
classical electrodynamics, is in general very small compared to the
coupling between the particles in the atom. It is, in fact, possible
in a description of the state of an atom to a considerable extent to
neglect the reaction of radiation, thus disregarding the unsharpness in
the energy values connected with the lifetime of the stationary states
according to relation (2) (cf. <i>Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc</i>., 1924
[Supplement], or <i>Zeits. f. Phys</i>., <b>18</b>, 117; 1923). This
is the reason why it is possible to draw conclusions concerning the
properties of radiation by using classical electrodynamics.</p>

<p>The treatment of the radiation problem by the new quantum theoretical
methods meant to begin with just a quantitative formulation of this
correspondence consideration. This was the very starting-point of the
original considerations of Heisenberg. It may also be mentioned that
an instructive analysis of Schrödinger’s treatment of the radiation
phenomena from the point of view of the correspondence principle has
been recently given by Klein (<i>Zeits. f. Phys</i>., <b>41</b>, 707;
1927). In the more rigorous form of the theory developed by Dirac
(<i>Proc. Roy. Soc</i>., A, vol. 114, p. 243; 1927) the radiation field
itself is included in the closed system under consideration. Thus it
became possible in a rational way to take account of the individual
character of radiation demanded by the quantum theory and to build up
a dispersion theory, in which the final width of the spectral lines
is taken into consideration. The renunciation regarding space-time
pictures characterising this treatment would seem to offer a striking
indication of the complementary character of the quantum theory. This
is particularly to be borne in mind in judging the radical departure
from the causal description of Nature met with in radiation phenomena,
to which we have referred above in connexion with the excitation of
spectra.</p>

<p>In view of the asymptotic connexion of atomic properties with
classical electrodynamics, demanded by the correspondence principle,
the reciprocal exclusion of the conception of stationary states and
the description of the behaviour of individual particles in the atom
might be regarded as a difficulty. In fact, the connexion in question
means that in the limit of large quantum numbers where the relative
difference between adjacent stationary states vanishes asymptotically,
mechanical pictures of electronic motion may be rationally utilised.
It must be emphasised, however, that this connexion cannot be regarded
as a gradual transition towards classical theory in the sense that the
quantum postulate would lose its significance for high quantum numbers.
On the contrary, the conclusions obtained from the correspondence
principle with the aid of classical pictures depend just upon the
assumptions that the conception of stationary states and of individual
transition processes are maintained even in this limit.</p>

<p>This question offers a particularly instructive example for
the application of the new methods. As shown by Schrödinger
(<i>Naturwiss</i>., <b>14</b>, 664; 1926), it is possible, in the limit
mentioned, by superposition of proper vibrations to construct wave
groups small in comparison to the ‘size’ of the atom, the propagation
of which indefinitely approaches the classical picture of moving
material particles, if the quantum numbers are chosen sufficiently
large. In the special case of a simple harmonic vibrator, he was able
to show that such wave groups will keep together even for any length
of time, and will oscillate to and fro in a manner corresponding to
the classical picture of the motion. This circumstance Schrödinger
has regarded as a support of his hope of constructing a pure wave
theory without referring to the quantum postulate. As emphasised by
Heisenberg, the simplicity of the case of the oscillator, however,
is exceptional and intimately connected with the harmonic nature of
the corresponding classical motion. Nor is there in this example any
possibility for an asymptotical approach towards the problem of free
particles. In general, the wave group will gradually spread over the
whole region of the atom, and the ‘motion’ of a bound electron can
only be followed during a number of periods, which is of the order of
magnitude of the quantum numbers associated with the proper vibrations.
This question has been more closely investigated in a recent paper by
Darwin (<i>Proc. Roy. Soc</i>., A, vol. 117, 258; 1927), which contains
a number of instructive examples of the behaviour of wave groups. From
the viewpoint of the matrix theory a treatment of analogous problems
has been carried out by Kennard (<i>Zeis. f. Phys</i>., <b>47</b>, 326;
1927).</p>

<p>Here again we meet with the contrast between the wave theory
superposition principle and the assumption of the individuality of
particles with which we have been concerned already in the case of
free particles. At the same time the asymptotical connexion with
the classical theory, to which a distinction between free and bound
particles is unknown, offers the possibility of a particularly simple
illustration of the above considerations regarding the consistent
utilisation of the concept of stationary states. As we have seen, the
identification of a stationary state by means of collision or radiation
reactions implies a gap in the time description, which is at least
of the order of magnitude of the periods associated with transitions
between stationary states. Now, in the limit of high quantum numbers
these periods may be interpreted as periods of revolution. Thus we see
at once that no causal connexion can be obtained between observations
leading to the fixation of a stationary state and earlier observations
on the behaviour of the separate particles in the atom.</p>

<p>Summarising, it might be said that the concepts of stationary states
and individual transition processes within their proper field of
application possess just as much or as little ‘reality’ as the very
idea of individual particles. In both cases we are concerned with
a demand of causality complementary to the space-time description,
the adequate application of which is limited only by the restricted
possibilities of definition and of observation.</p>

<p>When due regard is taken of the complementary feature required by the
quantum postulate, it seems, in fact, possible with the aid of the
symbolic methods to build up a consistent theory of atomic phenomena,
which may be considered as a rational generalisation of the causal
space-time description of classical physics. This view does not
mean, however, that classical electron theory may be regarded simply
as the limiting case of a vanishing quantum of action. Indeed, the
connexion of the latter theory with experience is based on assumptions
which can scarcely be separated from the group of problems of the
quantum theory. A hint in this direction was already given by the
well-known difficulties met with in the attempts to account for the
individuality of ultimate electrical particles on general mechanical
and electrodynamical principles. In this respect also the general
relativity theory of gravitation has not fulfilled expectations.
A satisfactory solution of the problems touched upon would seem
to be possible only by means of a rational quantum-theoretical
transcription of the general field theory, in which the ultimate
quantum of electricity has found its natural position as an expression
of the feature of individuality characterising the quantum theory.
Recently Klein (<i>Zeits. f. Phys</i>., <b>46</b>, 188; 1927) has
directed attention to the possibility of connecting this problem
with the five-dimensional unified representation of electromagnetism
and gravitation proposed by Kaluza. In fact, the conservation of
electricity appears in this theory as an analogue to the conservation
theorems for energy and momentum. Just as these concepts are
complementary to the space-time description, the appropriateness of
the ordinary four-dimensional description as well as its symbolical
utilisation in the quantum theory would, as Klein emphasises, seem
to depend essentially on the circumstance that in this description
electricity always appears in well-defined units, the conjugated fifth
dimension being as a consequence not open to observation.</p>

<p>Quite apart from these unsolved deep-going problems, the classical
electron theory up to the present time has been the guide for a
further development of the correspondence description in connexion
with the idea first advanced by Compton that the ultimate electrical
particles, besides their mass and charge, are endowed with a magnetic
moment due to an angular momentum determined by the quantum of action.
This assumption, introduced with striking success by Goudsmit and
Uhlenbeck into the discussion of the origin of the anomalous Zeeman
effect, has proved most fruitful in connexion with the new methods,
as shown especially by Heisenberg and Jordan. One might say, indeed,
that the hypothesis of the magnetic electron, together with the
resonance problem elucidated by Heisenberg (<i>Zeits. f. Phys</i>.,
<b>41</b>, 239; 1927), which occurs in the quantum-theoretical description
of the behaviour of atoms with several electrons, have brought the
correspondence interpretation of the spectral laws and the periodic
system to a certain degree of completion. The principles underlying
this attack have even made it possible to draw conclusions regarding
the properties of atomic nuclei. Thus Dennison (<i>Proc. Roy. Soc</i>.,
A, vol. 115, 483; 1927), in connexion with ideas of Heisenberg and
Hund, has succeeded recently in a very interesting way in showing how
the explanation of the specific heat of hydrogen, hitherto beset with
difficulties, can be harmonised with the assumption that the proton
is endowed with a moment of momentum of the same magnitude as that of
the electron. Due to its larger mass, however, a magnetic moment much
smaller than that of the electron must be associated with the proton.</p>

<p>The insufficiency of the methods hitherto developed as concerns the
problem of the elementary particles appears in the questions just
mentioned from the fact that they do not allow of an unambiguous
explanation of the difference in the behaviour of the electric
elementary particles and the ‘individuals’ symbolised through the
conception of light quanta expressed in the so-called exclusion
principle formulated by Pauli. In fact, we meet in this principle,
so important for the problem of atomic structure as well as for the
recent development of statistical theories, with one among several
possibilities, each of which fulfils the correspondence requirement.
Moreover, the difficulty of satisfying the relativity requirement in
quantum theory appears in a particularly striking light in connexion
with the problem of the magnetic electron. Indeed, it seemed not
possible to bring the promising attempts made by Darwin and Pauli
in generalising the new methods to cover this problem naturally, in
connexion with the relativity kinematical consideration of Thomas so
fundamental for the interpretation of experimental results. Quite
recently, however, Dirac (<i>Proc. of the Roy. Soc</i>., A, 117, 610;
1928) has been able successfully to attack the problem of the magnetic
electron through a new ingenious extension of the symbolical method
and so to satisfy the relativity requirement without abandoning the
agreement with spectral evidence. In this attack not only the imaginary
complex quantities appearing in the earlier procedures are involved,
but his fundamental equations themselves contain quantities of a still
higher degree of complexity, that are represented by matrices.</p>

<p>Already the formulation of the relativity argument implies essentially
the union of the space-time co-ordination and the demand of causality
characterising the classical theories. In the adaptation of the
relativity requirement to the quantum postulate we must therefore
be prepared to meet with a renunciation as to visualisation in the
ordinary sense going still further than in the formulation of the
quantum laws considered here. Indeed, we find ourselves here on the
very path taken by Einstein of adapting our modes of perception
borrowed from the sensations to the gradually deepening knowledge of
the laws of Nature. The hindrances met with on this path originate
above all in the fact that, so to say, every word in the language
refers to our ordinary perception. In the quantum theory we meet
this difficulty at once in the question of the inevitability of the
feature of irrationality characterising the quantum postulate. I hope,
however, that the idea of complementarity is suited to characterise the
situation, which bears a deep-going analogy to the general difficulty
in the formation of human ideas, inherent in the distinction between
subject and object.</p>
